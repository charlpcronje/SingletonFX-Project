Certainly! Here's a prompt summarizing our work in this context and outlining your next steps:

"We've been developing a sophisticated server-side implementation of the FX framework, focusing on creating a flexible and powerful routing system. The core of this system is a manifest-driven architecture, where different aspects of the application (routes, assets, modules, views, API, data, database, AI, tools, and communications) are defined in separate manifest files and then combined into a single, structured manifest.

We've implemented a smart routing system that can handle various types of routes, including traditional handler functions, static file serving, and different content types (Markdown, CSS, JSON, YAML, XML, images). The routing system is designed to be Flask-like in its simplicity while offering powerful features like middleware support, HTTP method checking, and streaming responses.

The server-side implementation uses a modular approach, with different functionalities split into separate modules that are dynamically loaded based on the manifest definitions. This approach allows for easy expansion and maintenance of the codebase.

We've also addressed cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) to ensure smooth communication between different subdomains of the application.

The next step is to focus on the client-side implementation of FX, specifically on creating components and making them reactive. We want to explore ways to define, render, and update components efficiently, possibly drawing inspiration from modern frontend frameworks but tailoring the approach to fit with FX's philosophy of providing a sync-like API and efficient resource management.

In the upcoming discussion, we should consider:
1. Component definition syntax
2. State management within components
3. Reactivity system for automatic updates
4. Efficient rendering and DOM manipulation
5. Component lifecycle management
6. Integration with the existing FX manifest system
7. Handling component dependencies and nested components
8. Event handling and custom event systems
9. Performance optimizations for component rendering and updates
10. Server-side rendering capabilities for components

The goal is to create a component system that is intuitive to use, performs well, and integrates seamlessly with the rest of the FX framework, both on the client and server sides."

This prompt encapsulates our work on the server-side implementation and sets the stage for developing the client-side component system in the next phase of the project.
