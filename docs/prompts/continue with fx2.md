I'm working on a JavaScript library called FX, which provides a sync-like API for handling various types of resources, including modules, API endpoints, CSS, HTML, and data storage. The library uses a manifest system for declaring resources and implements lazy loading. Here's a detailed breakdown of the FX class and its features:

1. Core FX Class Structure:
```javascript
class FX {
    constructor() {
        this.manifestObj = {};
        this.resources = new Map();
        this.dynamicProperties = new Map();
        this.context = new ExecutionContext();
        this.dbPromise = this.initIndexedDB();

        this.loadManifest(initialManifest);

        return new Proxy(this, {
            get: (target, prop) => this.handleGet(target, prop, []),
            set: (target, prop, value) => this.handleSet(target, prop, value, [])
        });
    }

    // ... other methods ...
}
```

2. Manifest Loading:
The `loadManifest` method recursively processes the manifest, creating nested structures and resources:
```javascript
loadManifest(manifestObj, prefix = '') {
    // ... implementation ...
}
```

3. Resource Creation:
The `createResource` method instantiates different resource types based on the manifest configuration:
```javascript
createResource(config, fullPath) {
    // ... implementation ...
}
```

4. Property Access Handling:
The `handleGet` method manages access to properties, resources, and nested objects:
```javascript
handleGet(target, prop, path) {
    // ... implementation ...
}
```

5. Property Setting:
The `handleSet` method manages setting properties and dynamic properties:
```javascript
handleSet(target, prop, value, path) {
    // ... implementation ...
}
```

6. Nested Value Retrieval:
The `getNestedValue` method retrieves values from nested objects:
```javascript
getNestedValue(obj, path) {
    // ... implementation ...
}
```

7. Special Property Handling:
- IndexedDB access via `db` property
- localStorage access via `store` property
- sessionStorage access via `session` property
- Environment variable access via `env` property

8. Resource Types:
- APIResource: Handles API endpoints
- CSSResource: Manages CSS loading and manipulation
- HTMLResource: Handles HTML template loading
- ModuleResource: Manages JavaScript module loading
- DataResource: Handles data file loading (JSON, XML, YML)
- RawResource: Manages raw file loading

9. ExecutionContext:
Manages asynchronous operations to provide a sync-like API:
```javascript
class ExecutionContext {
    // ... implementation ...
}
```

10. Proxy Handling:
Uses JavaScript Proxy to intercept property access and method calls.

11. Dynamic Properties:
Allows setting and getting of dynamic properties at any depth.

12. Lazy Loading:
Resources are loaded only when accessed, improving performance.

13. Caching:
Loaded resources are cached to prevent unnecessary reloading.

14. Error Handling:
Implements error handling for resource loading and API calls.

15. Extensibility:
The system is designed to be easily extended with new resource types.

Key Considerations:
- Maintaining the sync-like API while handling asynchronous operations
- Efficient handling of nested properties and resources
- Proper implementation of lazy loading and caching
- Correct handling of different resource types
- Ensuring the manifest structure is properly loaded and accessible

The FX class aims to provide a seamless, easy-to-use interface for resource management while handling complex operations behind the scenes. It should maintain consistency across different types of resources and provide a unified API for accessing them.

Please review and enhance this implementation, ensuring all features are correctly implemented and work together seamlessly. Pay special attention to maintaining the sync-like API, proper resource loading, and efficient property access.
